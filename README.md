# Gym Workout Planner App – Rapid UX Research & Figma Prototype

**Duration:** Oct 2025 (Lab Test – 3 Hours)  
**Team:** 4 Members  
**Associated with:** SLIIT  

## Project Overview
This project involved the rapid design of a Gym Workout Planner mobile application prototype as part of a lab test. Within 3 hours, our team applied user-centered design principles to conduct stakeholder research and translate insights into a functional Figma UI/UX prototype.

## Research & Insights
We conducted interviews with multiple stakeholders, including:
- Gym users
- Gym trainer
- Gym owner
- Sports physiotherapist

**Key pain points identified:**
- Lack of structured workout plans  
- Poor motivation and engagement  
- Time constraints for consistent workouts  
- Risk of injury due to incorrect form  
- Low long-term member retention  

## Solution & Prototype
Based on research findings, the solution emphasizes:
- Personalized workout plans  
- Goal-based routines (weight loss, muscle gain, general fitness)  
- Video exercise demonstrations  
- Progress tracking and smart reminders  
- Trainer-verified plans and guided warm-up/cool-down routines  
- Injury-aware recommendations  
- Community engagement and challenge-based motivation  

The prototype also addresses gym business needs, including class scheduling, trainer booking, member engagement analytics, and retention-focused features.
